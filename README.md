# colorlab

Package colorlab contains functionality to work with color palettes with a
focus on generating colors for editor themes and palettes that are structurally
similar to solarized.


Some of the code might be specific to
https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs and should be removed before a v1 of
this package can be considered.
